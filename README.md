# pyexp
Experimental python bits that are common knowledge but great to be mastered & baked into muscle memories.
I write these scripts out from several books, hence ideas are theirs and of course errors are mine:
  0. Automate the boring stuff - Al Sweigart
  1. Dive into Python 3 - Mark Pilgrim
  2. High performance python - M. Gorelick & I. Ozsvald
  3. Learn Python the hard way - Zed Shaw
  4. Effective Python - Brett Slatkin
  5. Python for Data Analysis - Wes McKinney
  6. Python for Finance - Yves Hilpisch
  
The module run tests with nose. To run test from the comand line, use ($nosetests -v) in the parent directory of the source.
