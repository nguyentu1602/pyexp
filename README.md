# pyexp
Experimental python bits that would eventually go to my blog or package.
I write these scripts out from several books, hence ideas are theirs and of course errors are mine:
  1. Dive into Python 3 - Mark Pilgrim
  2. High performance python - M. Gorelick & I. Ozsvald
  3. Learn Python the hard way - Zed Shaw

The module run tests with nose. To run test from the comand line, use ($nosetests -v) in the parent directory of the source.
